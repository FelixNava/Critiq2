# Critiq — Autonomous Decisions Log

Every non-trivial decision made by Full Auto without Felix's input. Read by the end-of-build summary; Felix uses this to confirm or iterate after the build run.

## Format

```
## DEC-NNN — {Decision summary}
Phase: N/{slug}
Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM ET
Type: [trade-off | obvious | conflict-resolution]
Bucket:
  - obvious: established plan applied; no alternatives existed.
  - trade-off: multiple reasonable options; one was chosen.
  - conflict-resolution: source documents disagreed; hierarchy applied.

Context: Why a decision was needed at this moment.

Chosen: What was decided.

Alternatives considered (only required for trade-off + conflict-resolution):
  - Option A: ... (rejected because ...)
  - Option B: ... (CHOSEN because ...)
  - Option C: ... (rejected because ...)

Rationale: Why this choice fit best given established plan + PRD + Brief.

Iterability: How easily this can be reversed if Felix wants different. (low / medium / high)

Trade-off flag: [YES / NO] — does this need Felix's review post-build?
```

## End-of-build summary

This section is filled by the master orchestrator at the end of every Full Auto run. It surfaces:

- Total decisions made (by type)
- Trade-off-flagged decisions (Felix's review queue)
- Conflict-resolution decisions (if any)
- Decisions where Iterability=low (highest review priority)

Felix reads this section first when reviewing.
